Temperature: There appears to be a positive correlation between how close cities are to the equator and higher temperatures. As we are about half way to the winter solstice, cities at corresponding positive and negative latitudes appear to still be experiencing similar temperatures. However, as we move closer to and reach the winter solstice, cities at a negative latitude (that is, in the southern hemisphere) will likely experience higher temperatures than those in the corresponding positive latitudes (northern hemisphere) due to Earth's axis tilt.

Humidity: There is an observable relationship between latitude and humidity. It appears that a greater number of cities closer to the equator experience high humidity than those further from the equator. Specifically, cities within the tropic region (23.5 deg. (north) to -23.5 deg. (south)) and sub-tropic regions (30 to -30) experience higher levels of humidity. There is also an appreciable number of cities in the northern hemisphere (50 to 70 deg.) that are experiencing high humidity. This is probably because the northern hemisphere is approaching the winter solstice.

Cloudiness and windspeed: Cloudiness does not appear to have a strong relationship with latitude. However, it is interesting to see the banding on the cloudiness chart. The banding shows that cities across particular latitude ranges are experiencing levels of cloudiness from their encompassing weather systems. Windspeed doesn't appear to have a strong relationship with latitude, but the data may indicate that some cities of more extreme latitudes are experiencing higher windspeeds than those if the tropics/subtropics.
