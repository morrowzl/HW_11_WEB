The objective of this project was to determine whether or not there was a relationship between latitude and certain weather parameters. 
Weather data for a randomly generated list of over 1300 cities was retrieved from the openweathermap.org API for current weather. 
The dataset was assembled using the Python pandas library and then visualized through matplotlib scatter plots. 
The scatter plots were used to compare weather parameters with latitude. The parameters of interest were: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. 

This site presents the project's data and findings. 
The scatter plot and relevant observations for each weather parameter can be viewed on the respective Plots page. 
The hyperlinked scatter plot thumbnails found on this Landing page will also redirect you to the respective Plots page. 
The Comparison page presents all four visualizations at once. 
The data used to generate the visualizations are presented on the corresponding Data page.
