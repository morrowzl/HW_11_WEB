<!-- block elements vs inline elements -->
<!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). -->
<!-- The <div> element is a block-level element. -->
<!-- It is used for block-level section grouping (e.g. for easy application of styling by class/id). -->
<!-- An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. -->
<!-- It is used for inline specificity or line-level section grouping. -->
<!-- The <span> element is an inline element. Multiple span elements could appear sequentially on the same line. -->
